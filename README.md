Dynamic Ride Pricing App
This is a Streamlit web application designed to implement a dynamic pricing model for ride-sharing platforms. Users can enter different parameters, and the app will predict the ride fare using a trained Random Forest Regressor model. The application also features visualizations that compare the predicted prices with the actual fares, offering insights into the model's accuracy.
